# CLion C Project Transformer

This plugin shall help CLion users to transform the boilerplate C++ project automatically created through CLion into a C project within a single click.

## Update

Starting CLion 2016.3.2, so-called [*Project Templates*](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2016/12/clion-2016-3-2-eap/#prj_templates) have been introduced, allowing you to choose between creating a C or C++ project. This plugin is thus no more needed. Nevertheless, I will let the code up here for future reference.
